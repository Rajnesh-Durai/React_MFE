# üõçÔ∏è Micro Frontend Shopping Platform
Welcome to Micro Frontend Shopping Platform, a modern, scalable online shopping solution built using Module Federation and Micro Frontends architecture! This project integrates four core micro frontends: Home, Product Page, New Arrivals, and Featured Products‚Äîall dynamically combined to deliver a seamless user experience.

# üéØ Project Overview
Our platform demonstrates how to effectively leverage Module Federation to build independent and scalable micro frontends. This allows teams to work autonomously on different parts of the application while ensuring smooth interoperability.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Micro Frontends (MFEs) in this project:
- Home Page: The landing page with dynamic product recommendations.
- Product Page: Detailed product descriptions, reviews, and purchase options.
- New Arrivals: Latest products and exclusive deals.
- Featured Products: Handpicked products displayed prominently for users.

# üöÄ Module Federation: Powering the Architecture
Module Federation is the cornerstone of our micro frontend strategy. Here's how we‚Äôve implemented it:

- Exposed Components: Each micro frontend exposes specific components or pages. For example, the New Arrivals MFE exposes the NewArrivals component that can be consumed by other applications.

- Remotes: Each micro frontend application can load and integrate remote modules from the others. For example, the Home page pulls in remote components from Featured Products and New Arrivals to render relevant data.

- Shared Libraries: Common dependencies such as React, React Router, and styling libraries are shared across all micro frontends to avoid duplication and ensure consistency across the platform.

# Key Benefits:
- Independent Deployments: Each MFE can be deployed independently without affecting the others.
- Scalability: Teams can scale and manage different parts of the application without conflicts.
- Improved Performance: By loading only the necessary parts of the application, we enhance user performance and experience.

# üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack:
- React: Frontend library for building interactive UIs.
- Module Federation: Webpack's feature for sharing code between applications.
- CSS Modules: Scoped styling for better maintainability.
- FontAwesome: Icon library for UI components.
